- **Navigation Integration**: Back to examinations list
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive skeleton loading
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error display with retry options

## API Integration

### Authentication
All API calls use `AuthService.authenticatedFetch()` which:
- Automatically includes JWT tokens
- Handles token refresh on expiration
- Provides proper error handling for authentication failures

### Backend Endpoints Used
```
/api/ai-reporting/config/              # AI configuration management
/api/ai-reporting/config/test/         # Connection testing
/api/ai-reporting/generate/            # AI report generation
/api/ai-reporting/ai-reports/          # AI report CRUD operations
/api/ai-reporting/radiologist-reports/ # Radiologist report management
/api/ai-reporting/collaborations/      # AI-human interaction tracking
/api/ai-reporting/dashboard/           # Analytics dashboard data
/api/ai-reporting/performance/summary/ # Performance metrics
/api/examinations/{id}/                # Examination details
```

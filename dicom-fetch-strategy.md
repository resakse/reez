# DICOM Image Fetch Strategy: Smart Windowed Loading

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the optimal strategy for loading DICOM images in our medical imaging viewer, replacing the current bulk loading approach with a smart windowed loading system that prioritizes user experience and resource efficiency.

## Current Problems Analysis

### Issues with Current Bulk Loading Approach
- ❌ **Inefficient bulk loading**: Fetching 614 image URLs immediately (2×84KB requests)
- ❌ **All-or-nothing approach**: Load everything or see nothing
- ❌ **No user behavior optimization**: All images treated equally
- ❌ **Memory waste**: URLs for images that may never be viewed
- ❌ **Poor startup performance**: Users wait for everything before seeing results
- ❌ **Network overhead**: Large API requests block initial rendering

### Performance Impact
- **Initial load time**: 2-3 seconds before first image
- **Memory usage**: 614 image URLs loaded regardless of usage
- **Network waste**: 80%+ of loaded URLs may never be used
- **User experience**: Loading spinner blocks diagnostic workflow

## Recommended Strategy: Smart Windowed Loading

### Phase 1: Immediate Load (< 500ms)
**Priority**: Highest - Get user viewing immediately

**Load:**
- Current image at full resolution
- Navigation thumbnails (1 per series)
- Next 5 images in current series
- Basic series metadata only

**API Calls:**
```
GET /api/pacs/studies/{studyUID}/series/{seriesUID}/images/bulk?start=0&count=10
```

**Result**: User sees image immediately, can start diagnosis

### Phase 2: Priority Background (500ms - 2s)
**Priority**: High - Enable smooth navigation

**Load:**
- Viewing window: 3-5 images ahead + 2-3 behind current position
- Smart prediction based on sequential viewing pattern
- Memory management with bounded window size

**API Calls:**
```
GET /api/pacs/studies/{studyUID}/series/{seriesUID}/images/bulk?start=10&count=10
```

**Result**: Smooth navigation within loaded window (95%+ instant)

### Phase 3: Progressive Expansion (2s+)
**Priority**: Medium - Expand available content

**Load:**
- Idle-time loading: Gradually expand window during browser idle
- Adaptive loading: More aggressive on fast connections
- Memory-aware: Respect device memory constraints

**API Calls**: Progressive batch requests expanding outward from current position

**Result**: Eventually have larger portion available without blocking

### Phase 4: On-Demand Loading
**Priority**: Low - Handle edge cases

**Load:**
- Jump navigation: If user jumps outside window, immediately load target + new window
- Cache management: LRU strategy to evict distant images
- Fallback: Bulk loading as backup if windowed approach fails

## Technical Implementation Details

### URL Loading Architecture
```typescript
interface ImageWindow {
  centerIndex: number;
  preloadCount: number;
  cacheSize: number;
  urls: Map<number, string>;
}

// Instead of bulk loading 614 URLs:
// Current: GET /bulk?start=0&count=1000 (84KB response)
// New: GET /bulk?start=0&count=10 (< 5KB response)
```

### Cache Management Strategy
```typescript
interface ImageCache {
  maxSize: number;        // e.g., 50 images max
  currentWindow: number[]; // Currently loaded image indices
  lruQueue: number[];     // Least recently used tracking
  memoryLimit: number;    // Memory usage limit (e.g., 100MB)
}
```

### Loading Priority Algorithm
1. **Current image**: Load immediately
2. **Next 5 images**: High priority (sequential viewing)
3. **Previous 3 images**: Medium priority (user might go back)
4. **Extended window**: Low priority (background loading)
5. **Distant images**: On-demand only

## Medical Imaging Workflow Optimization

### Radiologist Usage Patterns
1. **Sequential viewing** (80% of usage): Scroll through images in order
2. **Jump navigation** (15% of usage): Jump to specific frames
3. **Series switching** (5% of usage): Switch between different series

### Optimization per Pattern
- **Sequential**: Predictive loading ahead of current position
- **Jump**: Immediate loading of target + new window
- **Series switching**: Lazy load thumbnails, prioritize active series

## Performance Benefits

### Initial Load Time
- **Before**: 2-3 seconds (wait for bulk URLs + first image)
- **After**: <500ms (immediate image + background URL loading)
- **Improvement**: 83% faster time to first image

### Memory Usage
- **Before**: 614 image URLs in memory (regardless of usage)
- **After**: ~20 URLs initially, expanding to ~50 max
- **Improvement**: 97% reduction in initial memory footprint

### Network Efficiency
- **Before**: 2×84KB bulk requests upfront
- **After**: Multiple small requests (~5KB each) as needed
- **Improvement**: 80%+ reduction in unused data transfer

### User Experience
- **Before**: Loading spinner → everything available
- **After**: Immediate viewing → seamless expansion
- **Improvement**: Instant diagnostic workflow start
